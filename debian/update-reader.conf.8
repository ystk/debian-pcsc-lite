.TH UPDATE-READER.CONF 8 "Debian GNU/Linux tools" "DEBIAN"
.SH NAME
update\-reader.conf \- (re)generate /etc/reader.conf
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update\-reader.conf
[force]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B update\-reader.conf
is a simple tool to manage
.IR /etc/reader.conf .
The PCSC daemon (pcscd) uses one configuration file for its
configuration. This makes it hard for packages to dynamically add
information about their own smart card reader drivers. To fix this
.B
update\-reader.conf
has been introduced.
.PP
.B update-reader.conf
attempts to fix this by generating the configuration file from separate
files which are located in
.IR /etc/reader.conf.d .
All files in that directory are assembled together to form
.IR /etc/reader.conf .
.PP
After generation a backup of the old file is put in
.IR /etc/reader.conf.old .
.SH "FILES"
.B update\-reader.conf
will ignore files that match the following regular expression:
.RS
.B *\e(\e.dpkg\-[a\-z]*\e|~\e)$
.RE
(ie files with the extension
.IR .dpkg\-new ,
.IR .dpkg\-orig ,
.IR .dpkg\-dist ,
.IR .dpkg\-old ,
or whose filename end with a
.IR ~ ).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I force
.B update\-reader.conf
check if the current
.I /etc/reader.conf
is a generated file by checking for a special tag on the first line. If this
tag is not found generation is aborted. By supplying
.I force
as parameter only a warning is printed.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR pcscd (1)
.SH BUGS
None of course! :)
